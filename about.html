        </h2>
        <img class="aboutMe-profilePicture" src="file/img/about/profilepic_2.jpg" alt="Profile photo of Gabriel"/>
        <p>
            Hello there! My name is Gabriel and I'm a concept artist and illustrator from Gothenburg, Sweden. At the moment I'm currently located in Budapest, Hungary where I've been working as a full time concept artist at <a link="https://www.digicpictures.com/" href="https://www.digicpictures.com/" target="_blank">Digic Pictures</a> since January 2019. I still accept and do the occasional freelance work on the side.
        </p>
        <p>
            In upper secondary school I studied <em>Digital Production</em> meaning that at the age of 16 I was already learning software such as <em>Maya,
            Photoshop, Illustrator</em> and <em>After Effects</em>. In 2017 I graduated from the University of Skövde
            with a Bachelors Degree in Media Arts, Aesthetics and Narration at the Video Game Development programme with
            focus on 2D graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since I started doing proper freelance work in 2015 I've had the oppurtunity to work on multiple exciting projects such as Star Trek Fleet Command, Hades' Star, RAID World War II, Isac Asimov's Foundations Trilogy.
            And with my position at Digic Pictures I've had the oppurtunity to work on cinematics for companies such as Ubisoft, Bungie, FromSoftware, Activision, Iggymob, Reflector Entertainment with more counting. 
        </p>
