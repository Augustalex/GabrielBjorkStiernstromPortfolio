        <p>
            Hello there! My name is Gabriel and I'm a concept artist and illustrator. I'm from Gothenburg, Sweden which
            is also where I'm currently at doing freelance work.
        </p>
        <p>
            In upper secondary school I studied <em>Digital Production</em> learning software such as <em>Maya,
            Photoshop, Illustrator</em> and <em>After Effects</em>. In 2017 I graduated from the University of Skövde
            with a Bachelors Degree in Media Arts, Aesthetics and Narration at the Video Game Development programme with
            focus on 2D graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've been doing freelance work since 2013 but properly founded my own company in 2016.
        </p>
